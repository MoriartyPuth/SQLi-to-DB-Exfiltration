## 📋 Executive Summary
This repository documents a complete end-to-end security audit. Using proprietary automation, I identified a critical SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability in a web application running on **Nginx 1.19.0** and **PHP 5.6.40**. The vulnerability allowed for unauthorized access to the backend database, leading to the successful exfiltration of the entire `users` table, including plaintext credentials and sensitive PII.

## 🔬 Phase 1: Automated Discovery with Bubble-Bash
The exploitation lifecycle began with a scan using **[Bubble-Scanner](https://github.com/MoriartyPuth/bubble-scanner)**. The scanner's event-driven engine identified a hidden endpoint and immediately flagged a potential SQLi vulnerability by detecting backend syntax errors upon injecting an escape character (`'`).

### **Initial Reconnaissance Log:**

* **Scan Start**: Tue Feb 17 01:14:11 PM EST 2026
* **Target**: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com`
* **Finding**: `└─ [!!!] SQLi VULNERABILITY DETECTED`

## 🔓 Phase 2: Vulnerability Confirmation & Mapping
Following discovery, `sqlmap` was utilized to validate the injection point on the `cat` parameter of the `listproducts.php` endpoint.

### **Technical Findings:**
* **Back-end DBMS**: MySQL >= 5.6
* **Operating System**: Linux Ubuntu
* **Injection Types Identified**:
    * **Boolean-based blind**: `AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause`
    * **Error-based**: `MySQL >= 5.6 AND error-based`
    * **Time-based blind**: `MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)`
    * **UNION query**: `Generic UNION query (NULL) - 11 columns`

## 🗄️ Phase 3: Database & Schema Enumeration
The vulnerability provided deep access to the database architecture, allowing for the mapping of the `acuart` database and the extraction of sensitive tables.

### **Database Inventory:**
1. `acuart`
2. `information_schema`

### **Target Table: `users`**
The `acuart.users` table was found to contain 8 critical columns, including `uname` (Username), `pass` (Password), `email`, and `cc` (Credit Card / Sensitive Data).

## 💾 Phase 4: Data Exfiltration (Proof of Concept)
Final exfiltration demonstrated a complete breach of confidentiality. I successfully dumped records from the `users` table, revealing insecure data storage practices.

### **Extracted Entry Preview:**
* **Username**: `test`
* **Password**: `test`
* **Email**: `you`
* **Notes**: Includes stored XSS vectors such as `<script>window.location=...</script>`

## 🛡️ Technical Conclusion & Risk Assessment
The successful exploitation of this vulnerability represents a **Critical Risk** to organizational data integrity and citizen privacy.

* **Mass Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to PII and credentials constitutes a major security breach.
* **Account Takeover (ATO)**: Access to plaintext passwords allows for immediate account compromise.
* **Persistent Threat Vector**: Stored XSS vectors identified in the database dump suggest a secondary attack surface for session hijacking.
* **Legacy Risk**: The use of end-of-life software (**PHP 5.6.40**) significantly increases the attack surface.
